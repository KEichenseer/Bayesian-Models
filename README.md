# Bayesian Models
 R code for the Bayesian models presented at [keichenseer.netlify.app](https://keichenseer.netlify.app/).  
 
### [01. Change point regression in R](https://keichenseer.netlify.app/post/change-point-regression/)
 A straightforward method to find a change in the linear relationship of two variables. This implementation uses the JAGS program to sample from the posterior of the model.
 
### [02. Metropolis algorithm in R](https://keichenseer.netlify.app/post/a-metropolis-algorithm-in-r-part-1-implementation/)
 An R program that fits a generalised logistic function. The posterior of the unknown parameters is estimated with a Metropolis algorithm written entirely in R.
 
### [03. Adaptive Metropolis algorithm in R](https://keichenseer.netlify.app/post/a-metropolis-algorithm-in-r-part-2-adaptive-proposals/)
 This program expands upon 02. by using adaptation to optimise the proposals of the Metropolis algorithm.
