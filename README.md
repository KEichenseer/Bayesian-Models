# Bayesian Models
 R code for the Bayesian models presented at [keichenseer.netlify.app](https://keichenseer.netlify.app/).  
 
 **01. Change point regression in R**
 A straightforward method to find a change in the linear relationship of two variables. This implementation uses the JAGS program to sample from the posterior of the model.
 
 **02. Metropolis algorithm in R**
 An R program that fits a generalised logistic function. The posterior of the unknown parameters is estimated with a Metropolis algorithm written entirely in R.
 
 **03. Adaptive Metropolis algorithm in R**
 This program expands upon 02. by using adaptation to optimise the proposals of the Metropolis algorithm.
